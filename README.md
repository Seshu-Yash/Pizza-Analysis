## Overview

This repository contains the source code and data for a Pizza Analysis Dashboard created using Power BI and SQL. The analysis focuses on key performance indicators (KPIs) related to a pizza business, providing insights into revenue, order patterns, pizza category sales, and more.

## Key Features

1. **Total Revenue Analysis:** Understand the financial performance of the pizza business.
2. **Order Metrics:** Explore total orders, average order value, and average pizzas per order.
3. **Pizza Category Insights:** Analyze the percentage of sales and total pizzas sold by pizza category.
4. **Pizza Size Breakdown:** Break down sales by different pizza sizes.
5. **Top and Bottom Sellers:** Identify the top 5 best and bottom 5 worst sellers based on total pizzas sold.
6. **Daily and Hourly Trends:** Visualize the daily and hourly trends for total orders.

## Technologies Used

- **Power BI:** Utilized for creating interactive and visually appealing dashboards.
- **SQL:** Employed for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes.

## Data Sources

The data used for this analysis is sourced from the pizza business's database. SQL queries were employed to extract relevant data, perform necessary transformations, and prepare the dataset for analysis.

## Building the Dashboard

1. **Data Extraction:** SQL queries were crafted to extract relevant data from the pizza business database. This includes information on orders, pizzas, sales, and more.

2. **Data Transformation:** SQL was used for data transformation, ensuring that the extracted data is in a suitable format for analysis. This step involved cleaning the data, handling missing values, and aggregating information.

3. **Data Loading into Power BI:** The cleaned and transformed data was loaded into Power BI for dashboard creation. Power BI's intuitive interface was used to design visualizations, set up relationships between tables, and create calculated measures.

4. **Visualization Design:** Various charts and visualizations were created to represent the key insights and KPIs. This includes line charts for trends, pie charts for percentage breakdowns, and tables for detailed information.

5. **Dashboard Interactivity:** Power BI features such as slicers, filters, and drill-through functionality were employed to enhance interactivity within the dashboard, allowing users to explore and analyze the data dynamically.

## Usage

To replicate or explore the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Access the SQL scripts in the `pizza Analysis SQL.sql` folder for data extraction and transformation.
3. Import the data into your SQL environment.
